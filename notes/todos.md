# Thoughts and Todos

## Thoughts

- wanna do a script for deploy automation - github pages -- automatic deploy from master branch
- integrate Travis CI --- maybe...

## Todos

- setup an .eslint file
- include path to fonts in index.html and serve from app/src/assets/fonts
- Serve static assets (images) with an efficient cache policy -- webpack infinity since they are hashed

Accessibility

- Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.

Best practices
User Experience

- Make images smaller and serve with a pixel ratio of 1:2

  > Displayed size 240 x 250 | Actual size 240 x 250 | Expected size 480 x 500
